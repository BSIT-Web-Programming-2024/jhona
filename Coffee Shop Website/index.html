                    <h4>Affogato</h4>
                    <p>Affogato is an Italian coffee-based dessert that typically consists of a scoop of vanilla gelato or ice cream "drowned" in a shot of hot espresso. The combination of the cold, creamy sweetness of the gelato with the bold, rich flavors of the espresso creates a delicious contrast. It can be served as a dessert or a treat at any time, often garnished with chocolate, nuts, or a drizzle of liqueur.</p>

                    <h4>Ammericano</h4>
                    <p>Americano is a popular coffee drink made by diluting a shot of espresso with hot water. This creates a milder flavor compared to a regular espresso, but it retains the rich, bold essence of espresso. The drink is similar in strength to drip coffee but with a smoother taste. Its name is said to have originated during World War II when American soldiers in Italy diluted espresso to mimic the coffee they were used to back home.</p>

                    <h4>Espresso</h4>
                    <p>Espresso is a strong, concentrated coffee brewed by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans under high pressure. It has a rich, bold flavor with a thick, creamy layer of foam called "crema" on top. Espresso is the base for many coffee drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos. It is typically served in small, concentrated shots, and its intense flavor and caffeine content make it a favorite among coffee enthusiasts.</p>

                    <h4>Vienna</h4>
                    <p>Vienna coffee is a traditional Austrian coffee drink made by combining strong black coffee or espresso with whipped cream. The whipped cream is either added on top or stirred into the coffee, creating a rich and creamy texture. It is often served in a glass and can be garnished with chocolate shavings or cocoa powder. The drink originated in Vienna's famous coffee houses and is known for its luxurious and indulgent taste.</p>

                    <h4>Caramel Macchiato</h4>
                    <p>A Caramel Macchiato is a popular coffee drink made with espresso, steamed milk, and a sweet caramel drizzle. It is layered, with vanilla syrup at the base, followed by milk, espresso shots poured on top, and finished with a caramel topping. This creates a balance of rich, bold espresso with creamy milk and sweet caramel flavors. The drink can be served hot or iced, and it’s known for its smooth, sweet taste with a hint of bitterness from the espresso.</p>

                    <p>Mocha coffee, or café mocha, is a delicious blend of espresso, steamed milk, and chocolate syrup or cocoa powder. It combines the boldness of espresso with the sweetness of chocolate, making it a rich, dessert-like coffee drink. Often topped with whipped cream and sometimes chocolate shavings, it offers a creamy and indulgent flavor. The mocha is perfect for those who enjoy both coffee and chocolate and is typically served hot or iced.</p>
